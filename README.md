# ClassProject_Sorce_Code: Change Calculator

Introduction

This program will ask the user for the number of half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies the user has and then compute the 
total value. The total value of the change should be shown as the  number of dollars (i.e., a whole number) and then a separate number 
of cents (also as a whole number).
